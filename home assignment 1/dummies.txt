The get dummies function splits up categorical, non numerical columns into binary variables. The getdummies function is an easy way to include categorical features in your machine learning model, it has the advantage that it prevents a hierarchy between the different features. The function creates a new column for each category of a feature with names corresponding to the original column and its values. So naturally the new dataframe will come with more columns, depending on the specific dataframe, than the original data. A drawback could be that the new Datasets can end up being confusing and oversized to handle.
