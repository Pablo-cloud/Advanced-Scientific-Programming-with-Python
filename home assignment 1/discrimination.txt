As observable in the evaluation results from exercise b.), the gender has no influence on the results of the KNeighborsClassifier.

The RandomForestClassifier prefers to classify males as good credit takers, because the ratio for frac females to the switched females increased significantly, and the ratio for the males decreased. With the MLP its vice versa.
